HOW TO ANALYZE A FILE?

 - Make sure the file is in 'excel' or 'csv' format, and it should have
   all the reviews listed under the column with the header "Review".
 - For analyzing the sentiments for a complete file, first upload the
   file and then click on the "Analyze sentiments" button.
 - Click on buttons under the "Visualizations" tab to view different
   graphs and charts. They will be available to view only after the
   sentiments have been analyzed.

  
HOW TO ANALYZE INDIVIDUAL REVIEWS?

 - For analyzing individual reviews, just write the review in the 
   textbox and click the "Analyze Sentiment" button.
