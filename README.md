# Sentiment-Analysis-App
A desktop application for sentiment analysis of customer reviews, enabling business owners to analyse reviews and identify key themes.

In today’s time, businesses are using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to solve their business problems, automate their processes, and derive insights from their data. Sentiment Analysis is one such ML technique which helps the businesses to know their customers’ perception towards their products and services at a deeper level. This is especially true for the restaurant industry. Similarly, topic modelling is another such technique which helps the users to identify key themes in their data. Hence, providing a simple and effective tool to the restaurant owners to conduct sentiment analysis and topic modelling was the motivation and goal of this project. For this purpose, several Natural Language Processing (NLP) components and ML models were studied and compared. After the comparison, it was found that the ML model of Logistic Regression combined with FastText vectorizer provided the best results (61.14% accuracy) for sentiment analysis. Similarly, in topic modelling the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model combined with TFIDF vectorizer provided promising results. After the research, these models were integrated into a GUI-based desktop application. This application was later converted into an installable software so that the targeted end-users can use it on their system to perform sentiment analysis.
